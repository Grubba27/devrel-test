## Where do I start?

- Read the code and try to understand what is going on. If you have any questions, feel free to ask.

I have made a checklist so you can track of what you have done.

- [ ] Read `server/main.js`
- [ ] Read `imports/api/Chat.js`
- [ ] Read `imports/ui/App.jsx`

Make annotations on the code if you want to test ideas.

When you are ready, you can start working on the tasks.

### Tasks

_Note that all tasks must be completed in english._

- [ ] Make a video of how this app works. to make it short,
      use a TikTok/Reels format (vertical).

- [ ] Write a blog post explaining what is going on in the code,
      think that we will post on our social media.

- [ ] Write ideas of how you would share those contents,
      what would be a tweet to share this post,
      how we could be post it on linkedin, does not have to be a complete strategy,
      just an idea We want to see how you think.
